            <p style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify">Every car owner goes through the pains of servicing their cars through conventional garages. Whether it is an authorized service station, a multi-brand servicing station or your neighborhood garage, a car owner has to take out time and visit their preferred service provider. While the actual time spent on servicing a car maybe less than two hours, a car owner loses a whole day in getting their car serviced. Plus, none of the garages allow car owners to enter the service bay to check their car while it gets serviced. Such practices only increase the trust deficit and magnify the promise-performance gap leading to unhappy car owners.</p>
